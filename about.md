This page is designed to help the user discover new scotch distillaries.

The user inputs the fullness of body they desire in their scotch - on a scale from 0 to 4 where higher numbers indicate fuller bodied scotches - and the flavor notes they require.  Using the data (http://www.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/nessie/datasets/whiskies.txt), the page returns a random scotch distillary chosen from all scotchs with an exact match for body and any scotch with some level of each flavor note checked.

By clicking the 'Find Me A Distillary' button, the page reruns and can pull up another random distillary meeting the criteria (if more than one distillary do).

The page also displays a bar plot of relative strengths of all flavor notes present.
